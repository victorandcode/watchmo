# Description
The objective of this project is to show a clone Netflix's Search Page functionality with my own React+Redux design

![Demo of using terminal-gif](./video.gif)


## Scope (for the moment)
- Show a React component structure to replicate Netflix's Search Page
- Manage state using Redux when necessary
- CSS as faithful as possible
- All data from Moviedb's API. Some data not available is hardcoded or randomized (temporarily ;).
- Only GET actions
- Unoptimized image usage (no webp or svg)
- Unoptimized browser support
- Not responsive

## Technologies used
- React with ejected create-react-app template
- Redux
- SASS
- MovieDB API

## How to use
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
